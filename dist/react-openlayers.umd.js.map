The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as\n * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,\n * {@link ol.Map} has a `target` property, accessed with `getTarget()`  and\n * changed with `setTarget()`. Not all properties are however settable. There\n * are also general-purpose accessors `get()` and `set()`. For example,\n * `get('target')` is equivalent to `getTarget()`.\n *\n * The `set` accessors trigger a change event, and you can monitor this by\n * registering a listener. For example, {@link ol.View} has a `center`\n * property, so `view.on('change:center', function(evt) {...});` would call the\n * function whenever the value of the center property changes. Within the\n * function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()` would\n * return the new center.\n *\n * You can add your own observable properties with\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\n * properties with {@link ol.Object#getProperties object.getProperties()}.\n *\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`.

Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * An `ol.View` has a `projection`. The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view. Any value can be passed to the setters. And the value\n * that is passed to a setter will effectively be the value set in the view,\n * and returned by the corresponding getter.\n *\n * But an `ol.View` object also has a *resolution constraint*, a\n * *rotation constraint* and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * As said above, no constraints are applied when the setters are used to set\n * new states for the view. Applying constraints is done explicitly through\n * the use of the `constrain*` functions (`constrainResolution` and\n * `constrainRotation` and `constrainCenter`).\n *\n * The main users of the constraints are the interactions and the\n * controls. For example, double-clicking on the map changes the view to\n * the \"next\" resolution. And releasing the fingers after pinch-zooming\n * snaps to the closest resolution (with an animation).\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* snaps to specific resolutions. It is\n * determined by the following options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`,\n * `maxZoom`, and `zoomFactor`. If `resolutions` is set, the other three\n * options are ignored. See documentation for each option for more\n * information.\n *\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\n * By default the rotation value is snapped to zero when approaching the\n * horizontal.\n *\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By\n * default the center is not constrained at all.\n *\n * @constructor\n * @extends {ol.Object}\n * @param {olx.ViewOptions=} opt_options View options.\n * @api\n */\nvar _ol_View_ = function(opt_options) {\n  _ol_Object_.call(this);\n\n  var options = _ol_obj_.assign({}, opt_options);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {Array.<number>}\n   */\n  this.hints_ = [0, 0];\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {Array.<Array.<ol.ViewAnimation>>}\n   */\n  this.animations_ = [];\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number|undefined}\n   */\n  this.updateAnimationKey_;\n\n  this.updateAnimations_ = this.updateAnimations_.bind(this);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @const\n   * @type {ol.proj.Projection}\n   */\n  this.projection_ = _ol_proj_.createProjection(options.projection, 'EPSG:3857');\n\n  this.applyOptions_(options);\n};\n\n_ol_.inherits(_ol_View_, _ol_Object_);\n\n\n/**\n * Set up the view with the given options.\n * @param {olx.ViewOptions} options View options.\n */\n_ol_View_.prototype.applyOptions_ = function(options) {\n\n  /**\n   * @type {Object.<string, *>}\n   */\n  var properties = {};\n  properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.CENTER] = options.center !== undefined ?\n    options.center : null;\n\n  var resolutionConstraintInfo = _ol_View_.createResolutionConstraint_(\n      options);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.maxResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.maxResolution;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.minResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minResolution;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.zoomFactor_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.zoomFactor;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {Array.<number>|undefined}\n   */\n  this.resolutions_ = options.resolutions;\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {number}\n   */\n  this.minZoom_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minZoom;\n\n  var centerConstraint = _ol_View_.createCenterConstraint_(options);\n  var resolutionConstraint = resolutionConstraintInfo.constraint;\n  var rotationConstraint = _ol_View_.createRotationConstraint_(options);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {ol.Constraints}\n   */\n  this.constraints_ = {\n    center: centerConstraint,\n    resolution: resolutionConstraint,\n    rotation: rotationConstraint\n  };\n\n  if (options.resolution !== undefined) {\n    properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.RESOLUTION] = options.resolution;\n  } else if (options.zoom !== undefined) {\n    properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.RESOLUTION] = this.constrainResolution(\n        this.maxResolution_, options.zoom - this.minZoom_);\n\n    if (this.resolutions_) { // in case map zoom is out of min/max zoom range\n      properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.RESOLUTION] = _ol_math_.clamp(\n          Number(this.getResolution() || properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.RESOLUTION]),\n          this.minResolution_, this.maxResolution_);\n    }\n  }\n  properties[_ol_ViewProperty_.ROTATION] =\n      options.rotation !== undefined ? options.rotation : 0;\n  this.setProperties(properties);\n\n  /**\n   * @private\n   * @type {olx.ViewOptions}\n   */\n  this.options_ = options;\n\n};\n\n/**\n * Get an updated version of the view options used to construct the view.

For a map to render, a view,\n * one or more layers, and a target container are needed:\n *\n *     var map = new ol.Map({\n *       view: new ol.View({\n *         center: [0, 0],\n *         zoom: 1\n *       }),\n *       layers: [\n *         new ol.layer.Tile({\n *           source: new ol.source.OSM()\n *         })\n *       ],\n *       target: 'map'\n *     });\n *\n * The above snippet creates a map using a {@link ol.layer.Tile} to display\n * {@link ol.source.OSM} OSM data and render it to a DOM element with the\n * id `map`.\n *\n * The constructor places a viewport container (with CSS class name\n * `ol-viewport`) in the target element (see `getViewport()`), and then two\n * further elements within the viewport: one with CSS class name\n * `ol-overlaycontainer-stopevent` for controls and some overlays, and one with\n * CSS class name `ol-overlaycontainer` for other overlays (see the `stopEvent`\n * option of {@link ol.Overlay} for the difference). The map itself is placed in\n * a further element within the viewport.\n *\n * Layers are stored as a `ol.Collection` in layerGroups. A top-level group is\n * provided by the library. This is what is accessed by `getLayerGroup` and\n * `setLayerGroup`. Layers entered in the options are added to this group, and\n * `addLayer` and `removeLayer` change the layer collection in the group.\n * `getLayers` is a convenience function for `getLayerGroup().getLayers()`.\n * Note that `ol.layer.Group` is a subclass of `ol.layer.Base`, so layers\n * entered in the options or added with `addLayer` can be groups, which can\n * contain further groups, and so on.\n *\n * @constructor\n * @extends {ol.PluggableMap}\n * @param {olx.MapOptions} options Map options.\n * @fires ol.MapBrowserEvent\n * @fires ol.MapEvent\n * @fires ol.render.Event#postcompose\n * @fires ol.render.Event#precompose\n * @api\n */\nvar _ol_Map_ = function(options) {\n  options = _ol_obj_.assign({}, options);\n  if (!options.controls) {\n    options.controls = _ol_control_.defaults();\n  }\n  if (!options.interactions) {\n    options.interactions = _ol_interaction_.defaults();\n  }\n\n  _ol_PluggableMap_.call(this, options);\n};\n\n_ol_.inherits(_ol_Map_, _ol_PluggableMap_);\nexport default _ol_Map_;\n","/**\n * Icon anchor units.
