The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as\n * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,\n * {@link module:ol/Map~Map} has a `target` property, accessed with\n * `getTarget()` and changed with `setTarget()`. Not all properties are however\n * settable. There are also general-purpose accessors `get()` and `set()`. For\n * example, `get('target')` is equivalent to `getTarget()`.\n *\n * The `set` accessors trigger a change event, and you can monitor this by\n * registering a listener. For example, {@link module:ol/View~View} has a\n * `center` property, so `view.on('change:center', function(evt) {...});` would\n * call the function whenever the value of the center property changes. Within\n * the function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()`\n * would return the new center.\n *\n * You can add your own observable properties with\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\n * properties with {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject#getProperties}.\n *\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\n *\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method.

The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The view states\n *\n * A View is determined by three states: `center`, `resolution`,\n * and `rotation`. Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * The `zoom` state is actually not saved on the view: all computations\n * internally use the `resolution` state. Still, the `setZoom` and `getZoom`\n * methods are available, as well as `getResolutionForZoom` and\n * `getZoomForResolution` to switch from one system to the other.\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view, but any constraint defined in the constructor will\n * be applied along the way.\n *\n * A View object can have a *resolution constraint*, a *rotation constraint*\n * and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* typically restricts min/max values and\n * snaps to specific resolutions. It is determined by the following\n * options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`, `maxZoom` and `zoomFactor`.\n * If `resolutions` is set, the other three options are ignored. See\n * documentation for each option for more information. By default, the view\n * only has a min/max restriction and allow intermediary zoom levels when\n * pinch-zooming for example.\n *\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\n * By default rotation is allowed and its value is snapped to zero when approaching the\n * horizontal.\n *\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By\n * default the view center is not constrained at all.\n *\n * ### Changing the view state\n *\n * It is important to note that `setZoom`, `setResolution`, `setCenter` and\n * `setRotation` are subject to the above mentioned constraints. As such, it\n * may sometimes not be possible to know in advance the resulting state of the\n * View. For example, calling `setResolution(10)` does not guarantee that\n * `getResolution()` will return `10`.\n *\n * A consequence of this is that, when applying a delta on the view state, one\n * should use `adjustCenter`, `adjustRotation`, `adjustZoom` and `adjustResolution`\n * rather than the corresponding setters. This will let view do its internal\n * computations. Besides, the `adjust*` methods also take an `opt_anchor`\n * argument which allows specifying an origin for the transformation.\n *\n * ### Interacting with the view\n *\n * View constraints are usually only applied when the view is *at rest*, meaning that\n * no interaction or animation is ongoing. As such, if the user puts the view in a\n * state that is not equivalent to a constrained one (e.g. rotating the view when\n * the snap angle is 0), an animation will be triggered at the interaction end to\n * put back the view to a stable state;\n *\n * @api\n */\nvar View = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\n    __extends(View, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {ViewOptions=} opt_options View options.\n     */\n    function View(opt_options) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        var options = assign({}, opt_options);\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {Array<number>}\n         */\n        _this.hints_ = [0, 0];\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {Array<Array<Animation>>}\n         */\n        _this.animations_ = [];\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number|undefined}\n         */\n        _this.updateAnimationKey_;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @const\n         * @type {import(\"./proj/Projection.js\").default}\n         */\n        _this.projection_ = createProjection(options.projection, 'EPSG:3857');\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {import(\"./size.js\").Size}\n         */\n        _this.viewportSize_ = [100, 100];\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {import(\"./coordinate.js\").Coordinate|undefined}\n         */\n        _this.targetCenter_ = null;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number|undefined}\n         */\n        _this.targetResolution_;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number|undefined}\n         */\n        _this.targetRotation_;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {import(\"./coordinate.js\").Coordinate|undefined}\n         */\n        _this.cancelAnchor_ = undefined;\n        if (options.center) {\n            options.center = fromUserCoordinate(options.center, _this.projection_);\n        }\n        if (options.extent) {\n            options.extent = fromUserExtent(options.extent, _this.projection_);\n        }\n        _this.applyOptions_(options);\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * Set up the view with the given options.\n     * @param {ViewOptions} options View options.\n     */\n    View.prototype.applyOptions_ = function (options) {\n        /**\n         * @type {Object<string, *>}\n         */\n        var properties = {};\n        var resolutionConstraintInfo = createResolutionConstraint(options);\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number}\n         */\n        this.maxResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.maxResolution;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number}\n         */\n        this.minResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minResolution;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {number}\n         */\n        this.zoomFactor_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.zoomFactor;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {Array<number>|undefined}\n         */\n        this.resolutions_ = options.resolutions;\n        /**\n         * Padding (in css pixels).\n         * If the map viewport is partially covered with other content (overlays) along\n         * its edges, this setting allows to shift the center of the viewport away from that\n         * content.

For example, to first zoom and then pan:\n     *\n     *     view.animate({zoom: 10}, {center: [0, 0]});\n     *\n     * If you provide a function as the last argument to the animate method, it\n     * will get called at the end of an animation series.  The callback will be\n     * called with `true` if the animation series completed on its own or `false`\n     * if it was cancelled.\n     *\n     * Animations are cancelled by user interactions (e.g. dragging the map) or by\n     * calling `view.setCenter()`, `view.setResolution()`, or `view.setRotation()`\n     * (or another method that calls one of these).\n     *\n     * @param {...(AnimationOptions|function(boolean): void)} var_args Animation\n     *     options.  Multiple animations can be run in series by passing multiple\n     *     options objects.  To run multiple animations in parallel, call the method\n     *     multiple times.  An optional callback can be provided as a final\n     *     argument.  The callback will be called with a boolean indicating whether\n     *     the animation completed without being cancelled.\n     * @api\n     */\n    View.prototype.animate = function (var_args) {\n        if (this.isDef() && !this.getAnimating()) {\n            this.resolveConstraints(0);\n        }\n        var args = new Array(arguments.length);\n        for (var i = 0; i < args.length; ++i) {\n            var options = arguments[i];\n            if (options.center) {\n                options = assign({}, options);\n                options.center = fromUserCoordinate(options.center, this.getProjection());\n            }\n            if (options.anchor) {\n                options = assign({}, options);\n                options.anchor = fromUserCoordinate(options.anchor, this.getProjection());\n            }\n            args[i] = options;\n        }\n        this.animateInternal.apply(this, args);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {...(AnimationOptions|function(boolean): void)} var_args Animation options.\n     */\n    View.prototype.animateInternal = function (var_args) {\n        var animationCount = arguments.length;\n        var callback;\n        if (animationCount > 1 &&\n            typeof arguments[animationCount - 1] === 'function') {\n            callback = arguments[animationCount - 1];\n            --animationCount;\n        }\n        if (!this.isDef()) {\n            // if view properties are not yet set, shortcut to the final state\n            var state = arguments[animationCount - 1];\n            if (state.center) {\n                this.setCenterInternal(state.center);\n            }\n            if (state.zoom !== undefined) {\n                this.setZoom(state.zoom);\n            }\n            if (state.rotation !== undefined) {\n                this.setRotation(state.rotation);\n            }\n            if (callback) {\n                animationCallback(callback, true);\n            }\n            return;\n        }\n        var start = Date.now();\n        var center = this.targetCenter_.slice();\n        var resolution = this.targetResolution_;\n        var rotation = this.targetRotation_;\n        var series = [];\n        for (var i = 0; i < animationCount; ++i) {\n            var options = /** @type {AnimationOptions} */ (arguments[i]);\n            var animation = {\n                start: start,\n                complete: false,\n                anchor: options.anchor,\n                duration: options.duration !== undefined ?

There are two types of shaders:\n *\n *   Vertex shaders are used to manipulate the position and attribute of *vertices* of rendered primitives (ie. corners of a square).\n *   Outputs are:\n *\n *   * `gl_Position`: position of the vertex in screen space\n *\n *   * Varyings usually prefixed with `v_` are passed on to the fragment shader\n *\n *   Fragment shaders are used to control the actual color of the pixels drawn on screen. Their only output is `gl_FragColor`.\n *\n *   Both shaders can take *uniforms* or *attributes* as input. Attributes are explained later. Uniforms are common, read-only values that\n *   can be changed at every frame and can be of type float, arrays of float or images.\n *\n *   Shaders must be compiled and assembled into a program like so:\n *   ```js\n *   // here we simply create two shaders and assemble them in a program which is then used\n *   // for subsequent rendering calls\n *   const vertexShader = new WebGLVertex(VERTEX_SHADER);\n *   const fragmentShader = new WebGLFragment(FRAGMENT_SHADER);\n *   const program = this.context.getProgram(fragmentShader, vertexShader);\n *   helper.useProgram(this.program);\n *   ```\n *\n *   Uniforms are defined using the `uniforms` option and can either be explicit values or callbacks taking the frame state as argument.\n *   You can also change their value along the way like so:\n *   ```js\n *   helper.setUniformFloatValue('u_value', valueAsNumber);\n *   ```\n *\n * ### Defining post processing passes\n *\n *   *Post processing* describes the act of rendering primitives to a texture, and then rendering this texture to the final canvas\n *   while applying special effects in screen space.\n *   Typical uses are: blurring, color manipulation, depth of field, filtering...\n *\n *   The `WebGLHelper` class offers the possibility to define post processes at creation time using the `postProcesses` option.\n *   A post process step accepts the following options:\n *\n *   * `fragmentShader` and `vertexShader`: text literals in GLSL language that will be compiled and used in the post processing step.\n *   * `uniforms`: uniforms can be defined for the post processing steps just like for the main render.\n *   * `scaleRatio`: allows using an intermediate texture smaller or higher than the final canvas in the post processing step.\n *     This is typically used in blur steps to reduce the performance overhead by using an already downsampled texture as input.\n *\n *   The {@link module:ol/webgl/PostProcessingPass~WebGLPostProcessingPass} class is used internally, refer to its documentation for more info.\n *\n * ### Binding WebGL buffers and flushing data into them\n *\n *   Data that must be passed to the GPU has to be transferred using {@link module:ol/webgl/Buffer~WebGLArrayBuffer} objects.\n *   A buffer has to be created only once, but must be bound every time the buffer content will be used for rendering.\n *   This is done using {@link bindBuffer}.\n *   When the buffer's array content has changed, the new data has to be flushed to the GPU memory; this is done using\n *   {@link flushBufferData}. Note: this operation is expensive and should be done as infrequently as possible.\n *\n *   When binding an array buffer, a `target` parameter must be given: it should be either {@link module:ol/webgl.ARRAY_BUFFER}\n *   (if the buffer contains vertices data) or {@link module:ol/webgl.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER} (if the buffer contains indices data).\n *\n *   Examples below:\n *   ```js\n *   // at initialization phase\n *   const verticesBuffer = new WebGLArrayBuffer([], DYNAMIC_DRAW);\n *   const indicesBuffer = new WebGLArrayBuffer([], DYNAMIC_DRAW);\n *\n *   // when array values have changed\n *   helper.flushBufferData(ARRAY_BUFFER, this.verticesBuffer);\n *   helper.flushBufferData(ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, this.indicesBuffer);\n *\n *   // at rendering phase\n *   helper.bindBuffer(ARRAY_BUFFER, this.verticesBuffer);\n *   helper.bindBuffer(ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, this.indicesBuffer);\n *   ```\n *\n * ### Specifying attributes\n *\n *   The GPU only receives the data as arrays of numbers. These numbers must be handled differently depending on what it describes (position, texture coordinate...).\n *   Attributes are used to specify these uses. Use {@link enableAttributeArray_} and either\n *   the default attribute names in {@link module:ol/webgl/Helper.DefaultAttrib} or custom ones.\n *\n *   Please note that you will have to specify the type and offset of the attributes in the data array. You can refer to the documentation of [WebGLRenderingContext.vertexAttribPointer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/vertexAttribPointer) for more explanation.\n *   ```js\n *   // here we indicate that the data array has the following structure:\n *   // [posX, posY, offsetX, offsetY, texCoordU, texCoordV, posX, posY, ...]\n *   helper.enableAttributes([\n *     {\n *        name: 'a_position',\n *        size: 2\n *     },\n *     {\n *       name: 'a_offset',\n *       size: 2\n *     },\n *     {\n *       name: 'a_texCoord',\n *       size: 2\n *     }\n *   ])\n *   ```\n *\n * ### Rendering primitives\n *\n *   Once all the steps above have been achieved, rendering primitives to the screen is done using {@link prepareDraw}, {@link drawElements} and {@link finalizeDraw}.\n *   ```js\n *   // frame preparation step\n *   helper.prepareDraw(frameState);\n *\n *   // call this for every data array that has to be rendered on screen\n *   helper.drawElements(0, this.indicesBuffer.getArray().length);\n *\n *   // finalize the rendering by applying post processes\n *   helper.finalizeDraw(frameState);\n *   ```\n *\n * For an example usage of this class, refer to {@link module:ol/renderer/webgl/PointsLayer~WebGLPointsLayerRenderer}.\n *\n *\n * @api\n */\nvar WebGLHelper = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\n    __extends(WebGLHelper, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {Options=} opt_options Options.\n     */\n    function WebGLHelper(opt_options) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        var options = opt_options || {};\n        /** @private */\n        _this.boundHandleWebGLContextLost_ = _this.handleWebGLContextLost.bind(_this);\n        /** @private */\n        _this.boundHandleWebGLContextRestored_ = _this.handleWebGLContextRestored.bind(_this);\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {HTMLCanvasElement}\n         */\n        _this.canvas_ = document.createElement('canvas');\n        _this.canvas_.style.position = 'absolute';\n        _this.canvas_.style.left = '0';\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {WebGLRenderingContext}\n         */\n        _this.gl_ = getContext(_this.canvas_);\n        var gl = _this.getGL();\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {!Object<string, BufferCacheEntry>}\n         */\n        _this.bufferCache_ = {};\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {WebGLProgram}\n         */\n        _this.currentProgram_ = null;\n        assert(includes(getSupportedExtensions(), 'OES_element_index_uint'), 63);\n        gl.getExtension('OES_element_index_uint');\n        _this.canvas_.addEventListener(ContextEventType.LOST, _this.boundHandleWebGLContextLost_);\n        _this.canvas_.addEventListener(ContextEventType.RESTORED, _this.boundHandleWebGLContextRestored_);\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {import(\"../transform.js\").Transform}\n         */\n        _this.offsetRotateMatrix_ = createTransform();\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {import(\"../transform.js\").Transform}\n         */\n        _this.offsetScaleMatrix_ = createTransform();\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {Array<number>}\n         */\n        _this.tmpMat4_ = create();\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {Object.<string, WebGLUniformLocation>}\n         */\n        _this.uniformLocations_ = {};\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @type {Object.<string, number>}\n         */\n        _this.attribLocations_ = {};\n        /**\n         * Holds info about custom uniforms used in the post processing pass.\n         * If the uniform is a texture, the WebGL Texture object will be stored here.\n         * @type {Array<UniformInternalDescription>}\n         * @private\n         */\n        _this.uniforms_ = [];\n        if (options.uniforms) {\n            for (var name_1 in options.uniforms) {\n                _this.uniforms_.push({\n                    name: name_1,\n                    value: options.uniforms[name_1],\n                });\n            }\n        }\n        /**\n         * An array of PostProcessingPass objects is kept in this variable, built from the steps provided in the\n         * options.
